 Lyrics 

Romaji

kakushi aji nani ni shiyou
amakute shiawase na koto
junsui na otome gokoro
amai koi mo karame nakucha
setsuna sa kasanete mirufiiyu
sanmi mo tsumiage taruto
nigami mo chokoreeto keeki?
mahou kaketa amai kiseki

amasa wo osaete bitaa toka
miruku nashi no koohii toka
amai dakeja otona ni narenai no?
sonna no zettai ni zettai yada yada yada

nee ageyou ka amai wana
hora toriko ni shite ageru
sonna mahou kakeru kara
chotto dake matase tageru wa

"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Magical!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Yeah! Yeah!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Magical!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie..."

tatta hitoku chi ga tari nakute
akai ichigo mitaku iji hatte
amai tokoro nante misenai wa
kanpeki ni tsukuru mon
hitori demo, demo, demo

nee, kizuiterun desho?
wakatterun desho?
kakushi aji no koi gokoro
nigami toka sanmi to ka
souiu no mo tama ni wa ii wa
ijippari de wagamama na
sonna "amai mahou" tsukai

 Lyrics 

English

Making something happy and sweet,
What secret ingredient should I use?
Perhaps the true feelings in my heart
Sweet love must also be mixed in!
A Mille-feuille layered with sorrow,
A tart piled high with sour memories,
Even a bitter-tasting chocolate cake?
When I cast my spell, it's a Sweet Miracle!

Should I tone down the sweetness to make it bitter?
Like coffee without milk?
"Having only sweets isn't very mature, right?"
Something like that, I absolutely, completely won't accept!

Hey! You want to, right? To get caught in this sweet trap?
Now I've made you my prisoner!
I'll begin to cast this magic spell,
You'll only have to wait a moment and...

"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Magical!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Yeah! Yeah!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie, Sweetie, Magical!"
"Sweetie, Sweetie..."

Just one bite won't be enough!
This red strawberry (me) won't give up!
Don't go looking for other sweet places,
The perfect person for you
There is still only one of those!

Hey, have you realized it, right?
You get it, right?
The secret ingredient of true love
Bitter things, Sour things,
Even those things are fine sometimes
Because of this determined selfishness of mine,
I'll use this "Sweet Magic"
