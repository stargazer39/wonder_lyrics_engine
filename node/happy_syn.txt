[lyrics-english]
|Happy Synthesizer, I'll play you a melody
|that will reach into your heart
|-
|Fleeting one-sided love that is quickly lost
|is a funny story now that I think about it.
|Everything I saw looked like it sparkled
|Those days were smiling beautifully
|Is all I have to remember grinning and bearing it?
|Will you become an adult? I don't have to.
|So much I didn't know, but I couldn't admit it.
|We're just right for each other. I'm sorry, it was a lie.
|Happy Synthesizer, I'll play you a melody
|that will reach into your heart.
|Pointless "facades" and things you dislike,
|I'll erase them all for you with this sound.
|I'm not much good for anything, but there's just one thing
|I can do even though it's not much.
|I'll convey plain but rousing words
|through electronic sounds.
|-
|Falling in love with someone doesn't need reasons
|No need for "twisting the truth", right?
|Blaming it on the era and giving up, that's as far as you'll go.
|Nothing will start, until you step forward.
|I'm sorry to call you late at night...you were going to bed, right?
|How funny you just called! I was about to do the same.
|Like they're being tickled at the back of their hearts,
|a happy sound to an attracted couple.
|Happy Synthesizer, see, you'll be pleased.
|I'll play you this melody that will wipe away tears.
|Do you have to pretend you're stronger than you truly are? Not really.
|Embrace the real you inside.
|I'm not much good for anything, but there's just one thing
|I can do even though it's not much.
|I'll convey simple feelings that are a bit shy
|through electronic sounds.
