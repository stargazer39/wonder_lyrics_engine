[lyrics-english]
|It's showtime! Hey Hey
|It's showtime! Hey Hey
|Let's go!
|With a cast who can use magic and monsters who are burdened with trauma,
|Even I know that everyone's destined to disappear someday...
|With a ticket that's long past expired and a heartbeat fading over time,
|"Let's come again next year," is said without any promises being made
|It's probably already no-good
|How much is that?
|There's too much noise, so much noise and it keeps getting worse
|I want to be inspired straightforwardly, just as I always have
|In a deteriorating, abandoned room I simply dream on
|Hey! Let's cross the end of all of this, partying forever
|Hey! Spinning on a never-ending merry-go-round
|Hey! This world hasn't even started yet
|Hey! A birthday lasting every second and minute
|Hey! In the depths of Hell, a happy ending plays out
|Hey! This world hasn't even started yet
|-
|With a thick-skinned king and an alchemist full of desires,
|We'll all someday return to the earth, leaving our attachments behind
|Even bad gods
|Is that fake news?
|There's too much conflict, too much conflict and it keeps growing
|It's like when our arms are all tangled together, I couldn't help but worry
|So I'll brush off the dust and reboot it all
|Hey! A firework show that lasts a lifespan
|Hey! A roller coaster that spans the starry skies
|Hey! This world hasn't even started yet
|Hey! The best of the worst of crappy plays
|Hey! A flag that'll paint over a bad ending
|Hey! This world hasn't even started yet
|Hey! Let's cross the end of all of this, partying forever
|Hey! Spinning on a never-ending merry-go-round
|Hey! This world hasn't even started yet
|Hey! Let's break the plans for a harmonious future
|Hey! Ring the bell that marks a new life
|Hey! This world hasn't even...
|It hasn't even started yet
|-
|It's showtime
|Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey
